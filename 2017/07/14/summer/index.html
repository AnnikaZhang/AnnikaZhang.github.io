        <p>It’s been a month since I finished all the finals and started summer vacation. At this point when one-third of my summer has gone away, I’ll write a summary to remember and to reflect on my time management.</p>
<h1 id="Math-Research"><a href="#Math-Research" class="headerlink" title="Math Research"></a>Math Research</h1><p>I started REU with very high energy. I attended all the lectures in the first week, and I was very excited to learn some math in a new field, algebraic topology. However, after the second week, I was sick and stopped going to classes. My mentor gave me lots of algebra exercises and I started to procrastinate.</p>
<h1 id="Health"><a href="#Health" class="headerlink" title="Health"></a>Health</h1><p>Living alone is a challenge to a healthy lifestyle. In the beginning two weeks of living alone, I bought lots of unhealthy groceries and slept irregularly. I first got a soar throat and then it developed into cold. I’m feeling sleepy everyday, so sometimes I would just go to bed immediately after dinner and wake up at 3am. Enough of all the irregularity and unhealthiness. Now I strictly go to bed between 11:00-11:30pm, slightly work out after dinner, and restrict on a healthy diet. Concluding from the failure of my previous effort to loose weight, I think it’s important to keep a healthy lifestyle as habit rather than thinking it as a task. In the past, I would weight myself everyday and got so happy if the number went down a little bit. Then I though it was ok for me to reward myself some delicious food, which eventually ruined my tiny achievements. So this time I decide to not weight myself and just control the calories.</p>
<h1 id="Sleepy"><a href="#Sleepy" class="headerlink" title="Sleepy"></a>Sleepy</h1><p>This is a serious problem. I’m so sleepy everyday that I hardly have any time to do anything. From now on I’ll go to bed at 11:00pm and wake up at 7:30am everyday. I’ll try not to sleep too much in the afternoon (1 hour max).</p>
<h1 id="Travel"><a href="#Travel" class="headerlink" title="Travel"></a>Travel</h1><p>What’s the point of vacation without any traveling plans? Sadly I stayed in Chicago for the first three weeks of summer. I think I just need to get into the airport to have the feeling of vacation. Thinking that I would also have no time to travel when I came back to China, I decided to visit my friend, Ruifan in Pittsburgh. It was a really good weekend travels. I visited many 2 art museums, watched sunset and night views at Mt. Washington and visited CMU. I took lots of pictures with my friend. So happy!</p>
